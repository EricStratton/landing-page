        <hr />
        <h4 class="header">Education</h4>
        <p>
          I studied at <em>Western Washington University</em> where I earned a
          Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Marine
          Ecology through Huxley School of the Environment.
        </p>
        <h4 class="header">Job Experience</h4>
        <!-- prettier-ignore-attribute (<span>)-->
          I've worked in resturants since the age of 16. While in school, I
          participated in a 6 month internship with a local environmental group
          focused on <span class="emph">community interaction, citizen science, 
          and conservation through monitoring and engaging with local government.</span>
          I also co-founded and operated an event company for several years
          while in college. Along with a group of like-minded and close friends
          I produced dance music events in local venues around the city of
          Bellingham. I also DJ and maintained reguarlar bookings around the
          Bellingham and occasionally the Seattle area up until the COVID
          shutdowns.
        </p>
        <h4 class="header">Programming Interest</h4>
        <p>
          I graduated from <em>Western Washington University</em> in December of
          2019. I began applying for jobs in the environmental field shortly
          there after. I applied to several other postitions not related to
          environtmental work as well. At the time I was working at a small
          local cafe to support myself while I searched for a position that
          would set me on a career path. By March, I had yet to find a position
          and the COVID shutdowns began. By the end of March I was unemployed. I
          realized that I wanted to buffer myself from being in a similar
          situation in the future, so I reached out to an old friend who
          enrolled in a similar program in Boise, ID a few years earlier. He
          attested to his happiness with the work and that he was able to
          continue to work throughout the shutdowns. He helped me find Epicodus
          and after a couple of months of deliberation and uncertainty I decided
          to commit.

        <h4 class="header">Interests and Hobbies</h4>
        <p>
          I am an <strong>avid</strong> boulderer and have been for the past six years. I love
          bouldering for the physical and mental challenge it presents. I also
          love and appreciate the great community of individuals who participate
          in the sport. I made many of my long term friends at the bouldering
          gym in Bellingham. I recently joined The Circuit, a group of
          bouldering gyms in the Portland area, and have been spending my free
          time after class at any one of the three gyms in the area.

          I play the ukulele and I am currently teaching myself how to play the
          piano and recently began to teach myself guitar as well. I produce
          dance music and have a couple of synthesizers I like to play with when
          I am not doing any of the other things I like to do to preoccupy my
          time.
