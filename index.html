    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>
      I studied at Western Washington University where I earned a Bachelor's
      degree in Environmental Science through Huxley School of the Environment.
    </p>
    <h4>Job Experience</h4>
    <p>
      I've worked in resturants since the age of 16. While in school, I
      participated in a 6 month internship with a local environmental group
      focused on community interaction, citizen science, and conservation
      through monitoring and engaging with local government.
    </p>
    <h4>Programming Interst</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated from Western Washington University in December of 2019. I
      began applying for jobs in the environmental field shortly there after. I
      applied to several other postitions not related to environtmental work as
      well. At the time I was working at a small local cafe to support myself
      while I searched for a position that would set me on a career path. Right
